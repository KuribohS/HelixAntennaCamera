# HelixAntennaCamera

This Repository contains Files for a self-made Helixantenna which, if build corretly is abled to detect WLAN (5Ghz) and display the intansity of the signal on a Monitor.

# How to get started:

We will use a Helixantenna to catch the WLAN wavelengths. You can use another type of Antenna, but a Helixantenna is quite praticall. A Helixantenna is directonal, if we get a signal it always comes from a specific direction. This makes the Coding of the Camera script way easier.
